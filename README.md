# DataSpark: Illuminating Insights for Global Electronics

## üìÑ Project Overview
**DataSpark** is a comprehensive data analysis project focused on uncovering valuable insights within the global electronics industry. Using Python, MySQL, and Power BI, this project analyzes data on customer demographics, sales trends, product profitability, and store performance to drive informed decision-making.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Workflow
This project is organized into three main phases: **Data Preparation**, **SQL Integration**, and **Data Analysis & Visualization**. Each phase is executed systematically to ensure data accuracy and insightful analysis.

### 1. **Data Preparation**
   - **Objective**: Clean, preprocess, and structure raw data for analysis.
   - **Execution Steps**:
     - **Import Libraries**: Load essential Python libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `mysql.connector`.
     - **Load Data**: Import datasets for customers, sales, products, and stores using `pandas`.
     - **Data Cleaning**:
       - Handle missing values with `fillna()`.
       - Ensure accurate data types, especially for dates.
       - Convert date columns to datetime format with `pd.to_datetime()`.
       - Clean currency columns (like `Unit Cost USD`) by removing symbols and converting to floats.
     - **Output**: Cleaned datasets ready for analysis and SQL import.

### 2. **SQL Integration**
   - **Objective**: Import cleaned data into MySQL for structured data storage and efficient querying.
   - **Execution Steps**:
     - **Database Connection**: Connect to MySQL using `SQLAlchemy` and `pymysql`.
     - **Data Import**:
       - Use `to_sql()` from `pandas` to import each DataFrame as a table in MySQL.
       - Configure `if_exists='replace'` to update tables with each run.
       - Verify each table creation with a success message.
     - **Output**: Data structured into SQL tables, ready for complex queries.

### 3. **Data Analysis & Visualization**
   - **Objective**: Analyze and visualize insights on customer demographics, sales performance, and product profitability.
   - **Execution Steps**:
     - **Customer Analysis**:
       - Analyze customer demographics by gender, age, location.
       - Identify purchase frequency and average order values by demographic.
     - **Sales Analysis**:
       - Examine sales trends over time and identify top-selling products.
       - Assess the effect of currency fluctuations on sales.
     - **Product and Store Analysis**:
       - Evaluate product popularity, profit margins, and sales by category.
       - Analyze store performance based on location and size.
     - **Output**: Actionable insights from each analysis step, ready to be visualized in Power BI.

## üìä Key Insights
- **Customer Demographics**: Understanding buying patterns based on gender, age, and location.
- **Sales Trends**: Identifying revenue-driving products and regions.
- **Product Profitability**: Pinpointing profitable categories and managing pricing strategies.
- **Store Performance**: Assessing the impact of location on sales.

## üîß Tools & Technologies
- **Python** (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)
- **MySQL** (SQLAlchemy for Python-MySQL connection)
- **Power BI** (for visualizations)

## üí° Future Enhancements
- Automate the data loading and updating process with a scheduled pipeline.
- Integrate advanced analytics like predictive modeling for demand forecasting.
